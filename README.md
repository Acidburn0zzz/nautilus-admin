Nautilus Admin is a simple Python extension for the Nautilus file manager that
adds some administrative actions to the right-click menu:

*   **Open as Administrator**: opens a folder in a new Nautilus window running
    with administrator (root) privileges.
*   **Edit as Administrator**: opens a file in a Gedit window running with
    administrator (root) privileges.


## WARNING!

Running the File Manager or the Text Editor with Administrator
privileges **is dangerous**!
**You can easily destroy your system if you are not careful!**
**Think twice** before doing so!

You will be warned the first time you use one of the actions above.
